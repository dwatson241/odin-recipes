            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>

            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>

            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul></b>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees. Combine all of your dry ingredients,
                and mix them together well. If you like spicier scones, add another 1/2 tsp cinnamon,
                or better yet, some nutmeg or cloves.</li>
            <li>Cut in the 1/4 cup or margarine or butter.</li>
            <li>Shred your apple. Add the shredded apple, then the milk and mix until they form a
                soft dough. Add a bit of flour if the dough is too sticky, it really depends on how moist
                your shredded apple is.</li>
            <li>Knead a few times, working some extra flour into it until it is barely sticky. Divide 
                into two balls of dough.</li>
            <li>Flatten until they are two circles that are about 6 inches in diameter. If you like, scour
                lines on the top to divide them into 6 pieces.</li>
            <li>Place them on a well greased baking sheet and sprinkle them with brown sugar and/or cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Pop into the over and bake for 15- 20 minutes until they are golden brown. Remove and cool.</li>
            <li>When the scones are cooled,, whisk together the glaze ingredients until they are smooth. Drizzle
                over the scones then let harden completely.</li>
            </ol>
