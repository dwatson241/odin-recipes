        <p>These apple scones are absolutey delicious warmed up with a pad of butter on a brisk winter morning.
            Once you have this recipe down you'll never dread donning the winter clothing to drive to a coffee shop for a fresh
            pastry again! Super easy, chewy, mouth-watering breakfast heaven!
