        <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <b><li>Dried chickpeas</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and dill are key)</li>
            <li>Onion (yellow, white, or red)</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and pepper</li>
            <li>spices (cumin, coriander, and a little cayenne pepper)</li>
            <li>Baking powder</li></b>
        </ul>
        <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Soak chickpeas for 24 hours.</b> Cover them in plenty of water and add baking
                soda to help soften them as they soak. The chickpeas will at least double
                in size as they soak. Drain very well.</li>
            <li><b>Make mixture.</b> Add chickpeas, fresh herbs (parsley, cilantro, and dill), garlic,
                onion, and spices to food processor and pulse a little bit at a time until the
                mixture is finely ground. You’ll know it’s ready when the texture is more
                like coarse meal.
            <p> <em>Important:</em> Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl, cover and refrigerate for at 
                least 1 hour or overnight. The chilled mixture will hold together better, making it easier
                to form the falafel patties.</p> 
            <li><b>Form patties or balls.</b> Once the falafel mixture has been plenty chilled, stir in baking
                powder and toasted sesame seeds, then scoop golf ball-sized balls and form into balls or
                patties (if you go the patties route, do not flatten them too much, you want them to still
                be nice and fluffy when they’re cooked.)</li>
            <li><b>Fry.</b> Frying is the traditional way to cook falafel and yields the most authentic and best
                result. Heat the oil on medium-high until it bubbles softly (your oil should be hot enough
                around 375 degrees F, but not too hot that it causes the falafel to fall apart.)
                Carefully drop the falafel in the oil, using a slotted spoon, and fry for 3-5 minutes until medium
                brown on the outside. Avoid over-crowding the falafel; fry them in batches if necessary.</li>
