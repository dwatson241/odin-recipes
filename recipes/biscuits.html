        <h2>Fresh Homemade Biscuits</h2>
            <p>If you have ever been home on a Sunday morning and wanted some fresh biscuits
                with your breakfast then this recipe is for you. Keep the ingredients in your
                pantry so that you are prepared for your next biscuit craving!
            </p>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ul>
       <b> <li>2 cups all-purpost flour (250g)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>6 tbsp <em>unsalted</em> butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li></b>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For best results, chill your butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes before beginning
            this recipe. It's ideal that the butter is very cold for light, flaky, buttery biscuits.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425F and line a cookie sheet with nonstick parchment paper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove your butter from the refrigerator and either cut it into your flour mixture
            using a pastry cutter or (preferred) use a box grater to shred the butter into small pieces
            and then add to the flour mixture and stir.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter or combine the grated butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined (don't over-work the dough).</li>
        <li>Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and use your hands to gently work the
            dough together. If the dough is too sticky, add flour until it is manageable. </li>
        <li>Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently flatten
            layers together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold in half again, repeating this step
            5-6 times but taking care to not overwork the dough.</li>
        <li>Use your hands (do not use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough to 1" thick and lightly 
            dust a 2 ¾" round biscuit cutter with flour. </li>
        <li>Making close cuts, press the biscuit cutter straight down into the dough and drop the 
            biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have gotten as many biscuits as possible and place less than ½" apart
            on baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Once you have gotten as many biscuits as possible out of the dough, gently re-work the
            dough to get out another biscuit or two until you have at least 6 biscuits.</li>
        <li>Bake on 425F for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>If desired, brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven.
            Serve warm and enjoy.</li>

    In this iteration I corrected the list tags that were input incorrect. 
    This change was time-consuming but I resolved all of the list tags
    from <ol> to proper <li> tags as the layout design dictated.
    I learned to be a little more careful as mistakes like these are
    tedious to correct. Also, a closing <li> tag did not have a "/" 
    which caused a list item to be blank despite having the correct
    sequential char -->
